```Child Rule``` Selectors are separated by greater than. This is only one level deep.  
```Descendant``` Selectors are separated by a single space. These can be many levels deep.  
```Chaining``` Selectors have no separation and are run together. Apply to all where true. This can look something like ```h1#title.big```. Convention is to use the element, then class, then ID.
