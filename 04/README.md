# Section 4 : Multi-Page Websites
## Lesson 25 : File Paths

Absolute Path : The full OS path from the root folder. Do not use this method. If you move the source folder, the paths are no longer correct and addets won't display.  
```/Users/BMR59920/WORKSPACE/WEB/04/images/cat.png```

Relative Path : The OS path from the project folder. This is the prefered method since you can move the project and the assets will still display.  
```./images/cat.png```

The ```./``` denotes the current directory.  
The ```../``` denotes one level up in the directory structure. Multiples can be nested to travese further up the file system ```../../```, but this is not recommended.  

## Lesson 26 : What are Webpages?

Reinforcing paths. This lesson demonstrates how to create links to other web pages within this lesson.

## Lesson 27 : HTML Boilerplate

This lesson describes the tags associated with the HTML document. The document type. The targeted language. The head. The meta tag for defining the character set - usually UTF-8. The title of the website. The body element houses the content of the website : links, images, etc.  

Cool VSCODE shortcut to create the boilerplate : create new HTML doc and in the first character of the first row, type ```!``` - this will auto generate the structure of your HTML document.
