# Section 10 : Grid CSS
## Lesson 60 : Display Grid

Flexbox is a tool used to align content along a one dimensional line. This can be oriented for *either* the X or Y axis.  

Grid is a tool used to align content on *both* the X and Y axis.  

You will use Flexboxes inside a Grid for even more dynamic layout.

## Lesson 61 : Grid Sizing

```grid-template-rows``` and ```grid-template-columns```  

There are alot of options for these elements. ```repeat(8, 100px);```  No exercise for this lesson, just a web demo of many of the options and their behaviors.

## Lesson 62 : Grid Placement

Define terms: grid-container, grid-items, row-tracks, column-tracks, grid-cell, grid-lines.  
Can position each with ```grid-area: RowS / ColS / RowE / ColE```
